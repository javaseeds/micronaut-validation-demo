# Micronaut Validation Demo

This demo will show how to build out and fully unit test, the Micronaut Validation (available in v.1.2.0)
<https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#beanValidation>

Many of the standard validation rules will be shown including in the unit test why they "failed"
Look at these rules (perhaps more)

* NotNull/Blank
* Min/Max
* Before/After

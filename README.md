# Micronaut Validation Demo

This demo will show how to build out and fully unit test simple code build with in Micronaut v.1.2.0 using 
the new Validation framework it now has. 
<https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#beanValidation>

It will not be using Hibernate's Validation framework.

Many of the standard validation rules will be shown including in the unit test why they "failed"

Taking a look at these rules (perhaps more)

* NotNull
* Blank
* Min
* Max
* Size
* Before
* After
* Pattern
